### About this site


About blogs:

* The main reason to write blog is simply to learn their own knowledge and solutions, sorted out, convenient for their future use when they can turn over, quickly find. Just like the high end program ape CV techniques as simple!!

* Open source can also be seen by others, and it's good for others to read and learn. Then add TAB bar, music bar and so on to the web page, otherwise it is a little monotonous look, slowly do it, do the style is very complicated.

* Write a blog when you don't have much to do and write down everything you've learned. Writing a blog strengthens my memory and improves my thinking ability. I can understand a lot of things when I read them, but after a period of time, I tend to forget them because I don't use them in my business. If I write them down, I can sort out the ideas I understood at that time, so that I can remember them quickly when I read them again.

* The second point is that writing can promote me to understand some things I don't understand. Although few people read it, if I write it out, I can ensure that I can clarify the whole process of writing, and what I master is still my own. Wuhu!

* Study official documents, exercise self-study ability, exercise note-taking ability, exercise project ability

* The third point, of course, is to produce learning motivation, urge themselves to learn more, or the website will be one or two articles, looking at the poor.


## About the author


### to yourself


I often feel that the invention of computers and the Internet has brought such great convenience to human beings that people can know how to get started without reading instructions, but the road of programming is so difficult.

It's better to worry about the future than to work hard now. On this road, only struggle can give you a sense of security. Don't put your dreams on someone, and don't care too much about the whispers around you, because the future is your own, and only you can give yourself the greatest security. You say you don't like the present life, don't like nine-to-five, don't like busy from Monday to Friday; Your dream is to travel the world, to sleep until you wake up naturally and count your money. In fact, you are simply lazy and shirking your responsibilities. Life is not an inspirational story. Stop using big words like "dream" as excuses. It is better to do your best in a limited situation. Facing the sea, wistful!
